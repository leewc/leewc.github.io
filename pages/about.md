I'm Lee, currently a senior studying *Computer Science* at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**. 

I usually go by my last name as my first name, because it's a common occurrence people think 'Chuan' is my middle name which gets truncated to Wen Lee. I definitely prefer just 'Lee' over the single 'Wen'. 

I'm from originally **Malaysia** where it's easily over 32째C [89째F] and survived the cold winters here in Minnesota where it's usually -25째C [-13째F]. At this rate I've seen and lived with enough snow for a lifetime. I am also 8981 miles away (14453.5 kilometers for us metric people) from home.

I speak 3 languages, English, Mandarin and Bahasa Malaysia.

Though I am familiar that the generation I'm a part of [are probably unhappy](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html) due to this fixation on thinking we're all special and unique, doesn't mean we all can't dream.  

**Perhaps I forget this at times**, but on a more abstract scale what I want to do in Computer Science is to make a difference, and help people solve problems. Maybe it's the same kick I get when being able to help someone understand things better, on StackOverflow or in real life. To have made a difference in software that positively impacts another person's life.

Now aren't we all special snowflakes?
