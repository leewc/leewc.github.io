My name is Lee[^1], and I'm currently working at the world's most customer centric company, **Amazon.com** as a Software Development Engineer for about 6.5 years now. I studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

I speak 3 languages, English, Mandarin and Bahasa Malaysia. I'm originally from **Malaysia** but Seattle is my current `127.0.0.1`.

Though I am familiar that the generation I'm a part of [are probably unhappy](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html) due to this fixation on thinking we're all special and unique, doesn't mean we all can't dream.  

I went into this field to make a difference, help people solve problems (and money if we're honest). I still get a kick being able to help someone understand things better, on StackOverflow or in real life. To have made a difference in software that positively impacts another person's life.

> "The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well." -*Ralph Waldo Emerson or Leo Rosten*
