- College of Science and Engineering, Senior, Class of 2016
- CGPA: 3.48

------

## Skills  

I'm experienced with C# and Java in a professional environment, fluent in Python, OCaml and C++. Varied and less experience with other languages such as C, XAML, VB.NET, SQL, but I know my way around good enough.

Currently dabbling in web languages like JavaScript, and SASS (a superset of CSS) as well as looking at all the awesome web frameworks.

Technologies I've worked with include WPF, COM/DCOM, VMware Virtualization, Git, TFS, Visual Source Safe, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and InstallShield. Take a look at my [Projects page](/projects/) for a few projects I've worked on.
